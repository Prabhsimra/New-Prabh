## What is a Webpage?
* A webpage is a single document or page on the internet.
* It’s what you see when you visit a website URL (like https://www.example.com).
* Webpages contain content like text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements.
* They are created using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Static vs Dynamic Webpages
* **Static webpages** are simple HTML pages that don’t change unless you update the files.
* **Dynamic webpages** can change content on the fly, like social media feeds or online stores, often using JavaScript and backend technologies.
