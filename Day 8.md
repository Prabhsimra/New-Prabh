# computer networking
> Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computers and devices together so they can communicate and share resources, such as data, files, internet connections, and printers.

| Network Type          | Description                                          | Typical Coverage Area      | Example                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Personal Area Network (PAN)  | Connects personal devices, usually wireless           | A few meters               | Bluetooth between phone and earbuds |
| Local Area Network (LAN)     | Connects devices within a small area like a home or office | Home, office, building     | Home Wi-Fi or office Ethernet   |
| Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) | Connects multiple LANs within a city or campus         | City or campus             | City-wide Wi-Fi, university network |
| Wide Area Network (WAN)      | Connects multiple LANs/MANs over large geographical areas | Countries, continents      | The Internet                   |
| Campus Area Network (CAN)    | Connects LANs within a limited area like a campus       | University or business campus | University network            |
| Storage Area Network (SAN)   | Specialized network for data storage access             | Data centers               | Networked storage devices       |

# how to connect computer networking:
**Behind the Scenes of Connecting Two Devices**

1. **Physical Layer Connection**  
   - Devices connect via cables (Ethernet) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).  
   - Data is transmitted as electrical signals or radio waves.

2. **Data Link Layer Setup**  
   - Devices use their unique **MAC addresses** to identify themselves locally.  
   - Protocols like Ethernet or Wi-Fi format data into frames and handle error detection.

3. **IP Address Assignment (Network Layer)**  
   - Devices receive an **IP address** to enable communication beyond physical connection.  
   - DHCP servers (e.g., routers) assign IPs automatically; otherwise, static IPs are set manually.  
   - IP addresses ensure data is routed correctly between devices.

4. **Establishing Connection (Transport Layer)**  
   - Protocols like **TCP** establish a reliable connection via a handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).  
   - TCP manages packet delivery, ordering, and error checking.

5. **Data Transfer (Application Layer)**  
   - Devices use application protocols (e.g., SMB for file sharing, HTTP for web) to exchange data.  
   - Network discovery allows devices to find each other and share resources.

6. **Acknowledgments and Error Handling**  
   - Devices send acknowledgments to confirm successful data receipt.  
   - Lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted to ensure data integrity.
# What is Topology in Computer Networking?
> Topology refers to the physical or logical layout of how devices (computers, printers, routers, etc.) are connected in a network. It shows the arrangement or structure of the network, including how data flows between device
# Types of Network Topology
 Physical Topology

 The actual physical layout of cables and devices.

For example, how devices are physically connected with cables or wirelessly positioned.
  Logical Topology

How data flows through the network, regardless of the physical connections.

For example, even if devices are physically connected in a star, data might flow in a ring pattern logically.

| Topology  | Description                                   | Example                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Bus**   | All devices connected to a single central cable | Early Ethernet networks          |
| **Star**  | All devices connected to a central hub or switch | Most modern home or office networks |
| **Ring**  | Devices connected in a circular chain           | Token Ring networks              |
| **Mesh**  | Devices interconnected directly with many others | Wireless mesh networks           |
| **Tree**  | Hierarchical topology combining star and bus   | Large organizational networks   |
